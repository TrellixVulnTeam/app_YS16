Customer relationship marketing (CRM) is a business process in which client relationships, customer 
loyalty and brand value are built through marketing strategies and activities. CRM allows businesses to 
develop long-term relationships with established and new customers while helping streamline corporate

Why is CRM important
CRM enables a business to deepen its relationships with customers, service users, colleagues, partners 
and suppliers.

Forging good relationships and keeping track of prospects and customers is crucial for customer 
acquisition and retention, which is at the heart of a CRM’s function. You can see everything in one place 
— a simple, customizable dashboard that can tell you a customer’s previous history with you, the status of 
their orders, any outstanding customer service issues, and more.

Gartner predicts that by 2021, CRM technology will be the single largest revenue area of spending in 
enterprise software. If your business is going to last, you know that you need a strategy for the future. 
For forward-thinking businesses, CRM is the framework for that strategy.

Sales teams can use CRM to understand their sales pipeline better.
Sales managers can access reliable information about the progress of individual team members in achieving 
their sales targets, for example, and see how well individual sales teams, products and campaigns are 
performing too.

Marketing teams can use CRM to make forecasting simpler and more accurate.
They can get clear visibility over every opportunity or lead, and map out the whole customer journey from 
enquiry through to sale, so giving them a  better understanding of the sales pipeline or prospective work 
coming in.

Why choose a cloud-based CRM system?
CRM and the cloud computing revolution have changed everything. Perhaps the most significant recent development in CRM systems has been the move into the cloud from on-premises CRM software.

Freed from the need to install software on hundreds or thousands of desktop computers and mobile devices, organizations worldwide are discovering the benefits of moving data, software, and services into a secure online environment.

A cloud-based CRM system has the following benefits:

Faster deployment
Automatic software updates
Reduce costs while scaling quickly
Work from anywhere, on any device
Increased collaboration



It’s also possible to include information from customers’ public social media activity – their likes and dislikes, and their sentiment about specific brands and businesses.

Sales reps benefit from reduced admin, a deeper understanding of their clients, and the opportunity to spend more time selling and less time inputting data.
